#NeuralProphet project for Theoretical Foundations of DataScience course

---
This is the repository for NeuralProphet project for Theoretical Foundations of DataScience course. Contributors are Alexey Voskoboinikov and Polina Pilyugina.The main aim of this project is to improve NeuralProphet Library.

### Project outline
- Refactor the main model class from NeuralProphet with PyTorch Lightning
- Refactor the rest of the code to support PyTorch Lightning in accordance with existing API
- Adapt and include existing implementations of state-of-the-art models for time series forecasting under the NeuralProphet API
- Add hyperparameter tuning with Ray Tune as additional module to NeuralProphet
- Recreate LIBRA framework for benchmarking in Python and run it on NeuralProphet and our additionally included models
- Add neccessary tests and documentation for introduced functional

### Baseline solutions
